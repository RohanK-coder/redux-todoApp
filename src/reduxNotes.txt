redux - is a global store for usage of differnet components rather than doing prop drilling.

reducers - controllers to modify the values (just actions)
useSelector - this hook directly talks to the redux store
useDispatch - calls the specific reducer for modification

first - import configureStore into the store.js file
slice is where it all starts
